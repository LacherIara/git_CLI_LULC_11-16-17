PROPER R PRACTICE

From now on: Always format data for R and then provide tables as needed.

Naming files:
        - Maintain same # characters (including numerical)
        - Unique identifiers in same location in name
        - If all file names need to be called at once, and each have unique nomenclature, put all in same file, not subfiles. (easier in R)

Formatting R Tables
        • All columns must have a name
        • Column names cannot start with a #
        • Value must be the column name header. 
        • If calling in values from 2 distinct tables, any values you want to relate must have the exact same column name, including capitalization and underscores.
        • UNIT!: If it isn’t self-explanatory, the unit should be included in the column name without using numerals, e.g.  “thing_sqm”.
