# git_CLI_LULC_11-16-17

- For all new R script related to CLI land use modeling, use this folder: “git_CLI_LULC_11-16-17”. Copy paste the most recent one from “RScript_update_8-17-17” into the appropriate place here and then we edit from there. 
- Don’t change folder names – they are synced to my desktop git and online.
- Don’t change the name of the file – no date change, etc. Git will track it all.
- Only change names when creating new script for different model versions, and in this case rename by adding the “vXXXX” at the beginning. When a truly new (not edited for r script versioning/ perfecting ) script is made, also change the suffix date.
- I’m copying this all into onenote under R scripts tab.
